<h3>You see an old victorian house across the yard, isolated by dark forest. You start to go, and as you limp along, seeping blood all the way, you look back at the house, and see the siloette of a man standing in the shadows. He sees you, turns, and slowly walks back into the house. </h3> 
<hr>
<h3>You reach the house across the yard, which must have been at least a quarter of a mile long. You knock on the dark wood door, and are greeted by an old lady. She sees you, and rushes you inside, calling the police as she beckons you in. As the ambulance arrives and you are put in on a stretcher, you see the police, who you told about the man in the house, approch he door with their guns drawn. As you see them kicking down the door, you close your eyes, thinking of the siberian husky mix you left at home, and how he must be worried about you. </h3>
<hr>
<h3>You make a full recovery, and as you watch the news, your trusty dog at your side, you hear about 'The worst horror scene in Maine's history'. But you know that period of your life is over. You turn off the news and look outside, and you realize its sunny outside, the perfect weather for a walk with your dog. As you walk outside, leash in hand, you breath a sigh of relief, things are going to be ok.</h3>
