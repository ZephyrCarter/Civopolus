<h3>As you stay in bed, your fear and dread only intensifies. You know you have to get up and do something, but your own procastination and fear keep you in bed. Suddenly, a man opens the door to your room. He walks in, and sits on your bed, and even though you can feel the musty smell in your bones, you stay put, and he starts talking. "Your gonna be all right, kid, just wait for a minuite , and it will all be ok." He suddenly pulls out a syringe, filled with green liquid. Now is the time to decide, get up and try, or wait and see.....?</h3>
