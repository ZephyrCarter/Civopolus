<h3>You run into the hallway, but seeing a seemingly hidden door, you turn off the main path and enter this door. You stumble in, and find yourself in a dark wood panneled room. You hear the man approaching the secret door you just came through, and you need to think fast. You see a window with some large light blocking drapes covering it, and you see what looks like a closet. Which do you go to?</h3>

As you hear in horror, they walk briskly too the entrance of the closet. As you still hope they will turn around, the closet flies open, and the man is standing there. He stabs the needle in your chest, draining it in a matter of seconds. As you lose consciousness, you collapse, your eyes slowly closing as the man stands over you, his musk ever present as the blood pools in your mouth.<a href="https://zephyrcarter.github.io/Civopolus/rpg/death_screen_universal.html">Next--></a>';
